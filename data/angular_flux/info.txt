Each file contains 3 series of 5min of acquisition. The angle is in the filename and follows the standard mathematical rotation verse when watching towards north.

Each lines contains raw data for:
TDC ADC1 ADC2
The 3 series are separated by a line:
EOM 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
Where EOM stands for end of measure, and the twelve numbers are the scaler channels.
In this acquisition, the scaler is measuring:
SCA0: S1
SCA1: S2
SCA2: S1 and S2 concidence
